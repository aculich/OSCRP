# Institutional Systems

*Asset Type:*  Facilities

Systems outside a project's threat profile, but a critical component in the science process.  This includes staff workstations, laptops, networks, supercomputers, emailing lists, calendar services etc.  Note, the consequences of not understanding the risks in your institutions' systems could ultimately affect your science.
